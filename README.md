# BestBuyBot


This bot is used to automatically attempt to purchase items on Best Buy's website. This bot is far from perfect and should only be used by those who know what they are doing. I take no responsibility should you be banned from their site for using this bot. 

You must MANUALLY change the url link and input all of your information 
in the code in order for the bot to work properly for you!

Please be aware that you might possibly have to download python and the chromedriver extension. If you have to download them, put them in the same folder and if you have an E: drive, that is the best location as that is how it is in the code already. Otherwise, you will also have to manually change this in the code as well.
